    "Portfolio optimization is being considered as one of the early applications of quantum computing. You may use data providers or the csv files on the [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1PTjiX00a446ZF_44bceq7Lrmn1tST7rh). Choose historical data for 12 stocks for the years 2015, 2017, 2019 and find the 4 stocks with best equalized returns (i.e. relative to their initial value). For each part of the problem compare these 3 optimization methods: (a) a classical minimizer, (b) VQE, (c) QAOA.\n",
